🚀 Excited to share **Odyssey** - a beautiful macOS writing app I've been building that combines node-based organization with AI-powered content generation!

✨ **What makes Odyssey special:**
• Visual node canvas for organizing characters, plots, conflicts, and concepts
• Context-aware AI prompts that understand your story's relationships
• Dual AI support - works with Ollama (local) or Mistral AI (cloud)
• Beautiful typography optimized for writing
• Interactive linking to build connections between story elements

Whether you're working on a novel, screenplay, or any creative writing project, Odyssey helps you visualize and develop your ideas in a whole new way.
